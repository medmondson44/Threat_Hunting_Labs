Lab 1 

Scenario: Security has been alerted that this computer may have been possibly compromised. We need to answer the below questions. 
This lab will be fairly simple with the intention to make them more elaborate. Environment is also a little dirty as I was having a little trouble setting up.

1. What is the malicious executable?
2. What process did the malicious executable migrate to? 
3. Were any situational awareness commands run? If so what were they.
4. Which IP and port is the malicious executable communicating with?
5. Are there any other weird processes found that can be associated with the malicious executable? And if so did they run.
6. Give the chain of processes used by malicious executable. Ex. mal.exe ---> migrated.exe ---> other_exes.exe ran (Hint: Use ParentProcessGuids and ProcessGuids to chain them together)


Happy Hunting!
